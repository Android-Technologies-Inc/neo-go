# Changelog

This document outlines major changes between releases.

## 0.78.3 "Calcification" (22 February 2021)

We're updating NeoGo node for Neo 2 network with this release bringing a
number of fixes for various problems. Some were found during our internal RPC
compatibility audit and some are just backports from Neo 3 development
branch. There are no new features introduced, but it's an important
upgrade. Unfortunately we had to change the DB format to fix some problems, so
add some time for resynchronization to your node maintenance plan.

Improvements:
 * RPC documentation was updated mentioning all known differences with C#
   implementation that are considered to be not worth fixing (#1760)

Bufs fixed:
 * when mempool is full new transaction's hash could still be added into it
   even if transaction is to be rejected afterwards (#1623)
 * `gettxout` RPC API was returning data for already spent outputs, although it
   shouldn't (C# node doesn't do that, #1649)
 * `getrawtransaction` RPC call returned metadata for pooled (not yet accepted)
   transactions (#1648)
 * `gettransactionheight` RPC call returned zero height for pooled (not yet
   accepted) transactions (#1648)
 * VM CLI set breakpoints after target instructions, although it should set
   them before execution (#1648)
 * a peer could be disconnected and not reconnected again properly in some
   cases (#1648)
 * missing write timeout could lead to broadcasting stalls (#1648)
 * CN transaction requests could try to ask for more transactions from peers
   than it is allowed to by the protocol (#1648)
 * CN transaction requests could be trimmed unnecessarily (#1648)
 * FP Fixed8 values (GAS usually) could be unmarshalled from JSON/YAML
   incorrectly in some cases (#1761)
 * previous proposal reuse could lead to empty blocks accepted even if there
   are transactions in the mempool (#1761)
 * UTXO asset issuer wasn't properly stored by the node (#1760)
 * `getassetstate` RPC call answer used wrong field name for "frozen" data
   (#1760)
 * UTXO asset type was serialized as numeric code instead of a string in
   `getrawtransaction` and getassetstate RPC call results (#1760)
 * `getblockheader` RPC call didn't support block numbers in parameters (#1760)
 * `getblocksystemfee` RPC call returned block's system fee while it should
   return cumulative system fee from genesis block to the one requested
   (#1760)
 * system fee calculation was wrong for some types of transactions (#1760)
 * `gettxout` RPC call implementation was returning asset hash in wrong byte
   order (#1760)
 * `getpeers` RPC call implementation returned port numbers wrapped into
   strings (#1760)
 * `getenrollments` RPC call implementation returned duplicate wrong records
   along with proper ones (#1760)
 * NEP5 tracking code wasn't deleting entries with zero balance leading to
   excessive getnep5balances request outputs for some addresses (#1760)
 * NEP5 tracking code wasn't able to handle tokens overflowing int64 in
   transfer and balance amounts (like pnWETH, #1760)
 * `confirmations` value in `getblock` RPC call response was shifted by two
   (#1760)
 * some fields with default values were omitted for `getrawtransaction` and
   `getblock` RPC call answers with Register and Publish transactions (#1760)

## 0.78.2 "Colorization" (03 December 2020)

Release 0.78.2 adds some minor features to the node while still being
compatible both for protocol and for DB format.

New features:
 * `getblocktransfertx` RPC API to get list of asset-transferring transactions
   (both UTXO and NEP5) for a block, see docs/rpc.md for more details (#1516)
 * support for batched JSON-RPC requests (#1509)
 * `KeepOnlyLatestState` option to only track the latest MPT state and not store
   old trees, it's disabled by default (keeping old behavior) and can only be
   turned on for a new DB (resynchronizing state from the genesis block), but
   it allows to drastically reduce disk space requirements for mainnet node
   (and even make it work a bit faster while still having stateroot
   tracking). Nodes with stateroot disabled (`EnableStateRoot: false`) use ~53GB
   for DB at current 6.5M height, stateroot-enabled nodes (`EnableStateRoot:
   true`) require ~122GB, but with `KeepOnlyLatestState: true` setting (and
   `EnableStateRoot: true`) the DB size is ~56GB, so the difference is quite
   noticeable for disk-constrained setups.

Improvements:
 * mempooled transaction retransmission mechanism (#1532)

## 0.78.1 "Circumnavigation" (22 October 2020)

This is a bug fix release that solves DB access and seed reconnection
problems. If you're using LevelDB or BadgerDB for backend storage you need to
resynchronize your node for testnet and you're recommended to do that for
mainnet. BoltDB users can proceed with the old DB.

Behavior changes:
 * default mainnet configuration now has updated values for FreeGas changes
   height (6195000 instead of 6200000, #1412)

Improvements:
 * dBFT timer was tuned to eliminate block processing delay from the
   inter-block interval, this only affects consensus nodes (#1429)

Bugs fixed:
 * node using LevelDB or BadgerDB for backend storage had incorrect state for
   testnet (#1468)
 * node that failed to connect to seeds on startup never attempted to
   reconnect to them again (#1483)
 * node using BoltDB could panic in various situations like processing a new
   block, this was noticed on the master branch with 3.0 support and never
   seen on 2.x, although theoretically it could still happen (#1482)

## 0.78.0 "Cardioacceleration" (15 September 2020)

This version is a Neo 2.12.0-compatible release that follows DeFi-related
network changes while also introducing some new RPC functionality and fixing
bugs.

There is an important configuration update there, please check FreeGasLimit,
MaxFreeTransactionsPerBlock and MaxTransactionsPerBlock settings as they're
now height-dependent (see the default mainnet and testnet configurations for
example of how to configure them).

If you're using getutxotransfer calls, please resynchronize your node to fix
NEO values returned.

New features:
 * minimum network fee policy value can now be configured, but it defaults to
   zero for now (#1397)
 * stateroot import/export (#1307)
 * new `getalltransfertx` RPC call returning all UTXO and NEP5 transactions
   for specified account (parameters are the same as for `getnep5transfers`,
   see RPC documentation for details, #1399, #1404)
 * GetUTXOTransfers support was added to RPC client (#1399)

Behavior changes:
 * FreeGasLimit is now height-dependent (configured as a map, instead of
   simple value), default value for mainnet since 6200000 and testnet since
   4840000 is 50.0 (#1394, #1397, #1400, #1402)
 * getnep5transfers and getutxotransfers RPC calls now support limiting and
   paging in addition to time span selection, by default both only return a
   1000 of elements (and it's the maximum possible) for a single call (#1395,
   #1399)
 * MaxTransactionsPerBlock and MaxFreeTransactionsPerBlock are
   height-dependent now, the default values for mainnet and testnet change
   since 6200000 and 4840000 respectively to 200 transactions per block with
   199 free ones
 * RPC client's GetNEP5Transfers call was updated to support new parameters
   (#1399)

Improvements:
 * the project is now using proper YAML library import path (#1306)
 * the node will exit with an error if no valid password is provided for CN
   wallet (#1316)

Bugs fixed:
 * state root addition errors in CN logs (harmless, but annoying, #1313)
 * state root was generated by CNs before StateRootEnableIndex (#1320)
 * panic on consensus watcher node (#1314)
 * RPC calls working with 256-bit hash parameters were not accepting hashes
   with "0x" prefix (#1369)
 * getutxotransfer RPC call returned NEO values multiplied by 10‚Å∏ (#1386)
 * incorrect vout indexes in getblock or getrawtransaction RPC outputs (#1392)
 * network fee check was not accounting for LowPriorityThreshold correctly
   (#1397)

## 0.77.0 "Cornification" (11 August 2020)

This release is aligned with Neo 2.11.0 release, bringing important changes to
the NeoX consensus protocol, some bug fixes and new RPC functionality. It is
tested to work in consensus with 2.11.0. The DB format was changed for NEP5
tracking data and we also track UTXO transfers now, so you need to
resynchronize the DB from the genesis for this version to operate correctly.

New features:
 * `getutxotransfers` RPC call to track NEO and GAS movements. It accepts
   address as mandatory parameter, asset name ("gas" or "neo") and start/end
   time as optional parameters (similar to `getnep5transfers`). See #1268 and
   #1288.
 * `invoke*` RPC calls now support passing hashes to be used as verified ones
   during execution (for contract's `CheckWitness` calls), this functionality
   is also available in the CLI now (#1282)

Behavior changes:
 * `getnep5transfers` and `getnep5balance` now return raw balance values, the
   same way C# node does (previously the result was adjusted by contract's
   decimals value, #1250)
 * `getstateheight` RPC call response now uses lowercase field names (#1274)
 * `getnep5transfers` RPC call now accepts start/end optional time parameters
   (the same way C# plugin does), lacking start option the result might be
   different from the one returned by previous node versions (#1284)
 * we no longer support Go 1.12 to build the node (#1285)
 * NeoX consensus was reworked to exchange signatures during Prepare phase and
   emit stateroot message along with Commit (#1291). Note that this new
   consensus process is not compatible with 0.76.X versions of neo-go or
   2.10.3-neox-preview1 version of C# node, but it is compatible with 2.11.0,
   so you need to upgrade all of your consensus nodes for the network to run
   correctly. Also note that the default configuration for mainnet was changed
   to enable StateRoot functionality.

Bugs fixed:
 * `getnep5transfers` RPC call not returning results for migrated contracts
   (#1215)
 * incorrect consensus recovery message data for NeoX-enabled networks (#1270)

## 0.76.2 "Calibration" (19 July 2020)

Minor update for Neo 2. If you're running testnet node, we recommend to
resynchronize it to fix state mismatch at block 4516236, mainnet is not known
to have any similar problem so you can keep the old DB.

Bugs fixed:
 * rare panic on node shutdown (#1185)
 * VM not clearing alt stack when doing CALLs (#1158)
 * incorrect resource accounting for isolated calls (#1186)
 * state height wasn't updated properly for networks with StateRootEnableIndex
   higher than zero (like testnet, #1213)

## 0.76.1 "Conduplication" (15 July 2020)

Minor bug fixing for Neo 2 implementation. If you're affected by NEP5 balance
tracking bug, please resynchronize your node to get correct results, other
than that it's not required, the DB is fully compatible.

Bugs fixed:
 * block synchronization stalls on consensus node when it's not yet up to date
   and there are a lot of blocks to fetch (#1116)
 * getnep5balances and getnep5transfers RPC calls didn't support passing
   addresses as parameters (#1146)
 * NEP5 balance tracking was not aware of contract migrations leading to wrong
   data being returned for getnep5balances RPC call (#1144)

## 0.76.0 "Cross-pollination" (25 June 2020)

We wanted to make a 0.75.1-neox-preview1 release of neo-go compatible with
version 2.10.3-neox-preview1 of C# node, but then suddenly decided to make
something better than that and now release 0.76.0 instead which brings with
it configurable cross-chain functionality support. So there is no need to use
different node builds for different networks with NeoGo, one binary fits
all. As usual some bugs were also fixed, this time mostly concentrating around
consensus functionality.

New features:
 * cross-chain (aka neox) support, refer to docs/neox.md for details on what's
   included and how to use it
 * compiler built-in Remove function was added for slices/maps element
   deletion (#1021)

Behavior changes:
 * the default testnet config now enables state root with StateRootEnableIndex
   of 4380100, if you have a testnet node you need to either stay with the old
   configuration or remove the DB and resynchronize blocks from genesis
 * contracts using comparison with nil will fail to compile, this comparison
   actually never functioned correctly (#952)

Improvements:
 * storage cache flushing was optimized, improving block import speed by ~10%
   (#1014)
 * consensus process now logs a bit more relevant messages (#1041)
 * limits to invocation scripts were added to consensus messages (#1087)
 * transaction request retries were added in case consensus process is missing
   some transactions (#1095)

Bugs fixed:
 * dbft's failed nodes detection was tuned for the case of node lagging behind
   the network (#1009)
 * dbft was fixed to always process recovery messages for the current block
   (#1009)
 * compiler now initializes complex struct fields correctly (#952)
 * NOTEQUAL opcode is now only being emitted for integers by the compiler (#952)
 * typo in docker entrypoint script preventing proper bootstrap file passing
   (#1089)
 * MaxFreeTransactionsPerBlock limit wasn't really enforced (#1019)
 * changeview payloads were not processed correctly by the consensus subsystem
   (#1041)
 * dbft library wasn't including messages from higher views for last seen
   message checks (#1041)
 * recovery request sent instead of recovery message in one case (#1095)
 * some correctness checks were not done for proposed block in not all
   transactions were present when the node received PrepareRequest (#1095)
 * timeout wasn't properly calculated in some cases for Primary node leading
   to early PrepareRequest send (#1095)

## 0.75.0 "Caramelization" (28 May 2020)

A long-awaited Neo 2.0 update for neo-go that fixes a lot of subtle little
differences in VM and syscalls behavior compared to C# node that resulted in
storage state mismatches between two nodes. This release makes neo-go fully
compatible with public testnet and mainnet chains, for every transaction in
every block you get the same result.

But it's not just about bugs, as it's been quite a long development cycle,
we've also included some interesting new features like notification subsystem,
neo-debugger compatibility and BadgerDB support. Smart contract compiler and
interop packages were also updated making neo-go even better for developing
real-world complex smart contracts.

New features:
 * support for `for` loops with no condition was added to the compiler (#799)
 * compiler can now emit debug information compatible with neo-debugger (#804,
   #829)
 * experimental BadgerDB support was added (#839)
 * support for abi.json files generation was added for contract deployment
   with NEO-Express (#916)
 * RPC over websocket connections is now supported both by the server (with
   ws://$SERVER:$PORT/ws URL) and client (WSClient structure, #921)
 * notification subsystem was added for RPC server and client (using websocket
   connections, #895)
 * interop package now has a complete set of syscalls available (#795, #956)
 * push command was added to VM CLI (#967)
 * diff dumps are now supported in `db restore` CLI command (#991)

Behavior changes:
 * due to DB format changes you'll need to resynchronize your node from
   scratch (and it'll also update its state to a more proper one)
 * runtime.Notify interop now accepts varargs (#825)
 * compiler's `--debug` parameter is now used for debug information generation,
   use `--verbose` to get more internal compiler's messages (#829)
 * compiler now outputs hex-encoded contract's bytecode only with `--verbose`
   option (#829, previously it was always printed)
 * RPC client's representation of GetBlock results changed significantly (#951)
 * some interop functions changed their in/out types to a more proper ones
   (#956, though previous ones didn't really work, so no current code should
   notice that)
 * `skip` parameter to `db restore` CLI command was replaced by `start`
   (#991), when using full (non-diff) NGD dumps with short (`-s`) form they're
   compatible, but `start` (as a block index) makes more sense for diff dumps

 * (*Stack).PushVal in vm now supports all types of integers (#776)
 * state.AppExecResult now stores stack in binary representation (#782)
 * vm.NewBigIntegerItem now accepts int64 parameter (#788)

   allowed to gain 10% improvement in block import time for 1.5M mainnet
   blocks (#807)
 * storage.Find usage example was added (#795)
 * VM stack item tests were improved (#812)
 * `config` directory now only contains configuration files, no Go code (#423,
   #816)
 * local variables are counted more accurately now in the compiler leading to
   less waste in script runtime (#815)
 * NEP5 example was extended with minting function making it a bit more usable
   (#823)
 * DAO was refactored away into its own package from core (#832)
 * additional tests were added for bitwise and numeric VM operations (#833)
 * tests for VM CALL* instructions were added (#833)
 * consensus message parsing was split into two parts so that ordinary nodes
   won't touch CN's data (#862)
 * contract's metadata was moved into smartcontract package from rpc (#916)
 * interop packages documentation was extended (#956)
 * Docker build was fixed to use Makefile (#981)

Bugs fixed:
 * integer stack values were not following C# node format when being converted
   to JSON (#770)
 * vm now uses truncated division to match C# node behavior for negative
   integers (#773)
 * getapplicationlog and other RPC calls now convert Uint160 to JSON the same
   way C# node does (#769)
 * asset state JSON representation now follows the same format as C# node uses
   (with proper field names for 'id' and 'type' and without 'fee' add
   'address' fields, #785, #819)
 * `nextconsensus` field in `getblockheader` RPC call answer was using hex
   representation instead of address (#763)
 * `getcontractstate` RPC call implementation was using wrong format for
   `script` field in answer (#763)
 * `getnep5balances` RPC call implementation was using wrong name for
   `balance` field in answer (#763)
 * `getvalidators` RPC call was using non-compliant validators keys format in
   its answer (#763)
 * potential problems with GAS parameter handling in CLI (#790)
 * `contract init` CLI command was not working correctly (#792)
 * RPC calls now accept integer parameters in JSON strings which fix some
   incompatibilities (#794)
 * CALLI VM instruction was using wrong offset (#791, #798)
 * vm Map stack item for using different serialization format from C# node
   (#806, #808)
 * invoke* RPC calls were returning stack in `Stack` element rather than more
   compliant `stack` (#805)
 * slices of compound types were treated wrong by the compiler (#800)
 * wrong code was generated for struct variables declarations by the compiler
   (#800)
 * RPC client was incorrectly processing GetRawTransactionVerbose,
   GetBlockVerbose, GetBlockHeader, GetTxOut and ValidateAddress call results
   (#789)
 * type-specific transaction data was completely missing in getrawtransaction
   RPC call verbose output (#585)
 * documentation for wallet CLI commands was fixed to follow renames made by
   previous version (#814)
 * panic in map-containing notifications processing (#809)
 * VM Map implementation now has deterministic iteration order (#818)
 * MOD instruction behavior was fixed to follow neo-vm (#826)
 * negative arguments are now accepted for SHL/SHR VM instructions (#827)
 * improper in-block cache propagation leading to storage state differences
   with C# node (#821, #817)
 * CLI didn't check for mandatory `method` parameter presence for
   invokefunction command (#828)
 * wrong code generated by the compiler for return statements with no

   one type specification (#935)
 * NEP5 example contained wrong address check (#945)
 * improper code generated by the compiler for `op=` assignments to struct
   fields and slice elements (#954)
 * Storage.Find elements order was adjusted to match C# node implementation
   and eliminate state differences resulting from that (#822, #977, #988,
   #994)
 * step command wasn't really working in VM CLI (#967)
 * PICKITEM instruction implementation was fixed to reject improper input
   argument types (#965, #967)
 * Runtime.CheckWitness was fixed to only accept compressed keys (#968, #971)
 * input data length check was added to (*PublicKey).DecodeBytes (#971)

   #979, #984)

## 0.74.0 "Comprehension" (17 Mar 2020)

Functionally complete NEO 2.0 node implementation, this release can be used as
a drop-in replacement for C# node in any setting. It features full RPC
functionality support and full set of wallet operations. As usual, there
also was a number of bugs fixed, the node stability improved and some great
optimizations were also done (especially concentrated around DB interactions),
so even though this release has more functionality than ever (and it stores a
lot more chain data than ever) it at the same time imports blocks faster than
the previous one.

Of course we will make additional maintenance releases for NEO 2.0 when
needed, but following this release we'll concentrate more on NEO 3.0 features
and catching up with recent community developments around that.

   the transaction, it now only specifies the network fee part while system
   fee part is computed automatically based on contract's metadata (#747)
 * contract deployment and invocation from CLI is now integrated with the
   wallet subsystem, WIF parameter support was dropped (#747)

   interpreted as system fee), but it shouldn't (#718)
 * system fee calculation for Invocation transactions was incorrect (#718)
 * `Transaction` JSON unmarshalling was processing Outputs and Witnesses
   incorrectly (#706)

## 0.72.0 "Crystallization" (06 Feb 2020)

Starting at the end of the year 2019 we've spent a lot of effort to
stress-test our node with transaction load and this allowed us to uncover
some problems in various parts of the system. This release addresses all of
them and brings with it updated networking, consensus and mempool components
that can handle quite substantial transaction traffic and successfully produce
new blocks while being stressed. There are also important updates in VM that
fix incompatibilities with C# node and interesting improvements in compiler
based on our experience porting neofs smart contract to Go.

first release with a test coverage of more than 60% which is a significant
milestone in our trend to improve code quality and testing. Back in August
2019 when NSPCC had started neo-go developement the project only had a

## 0.70.1 "Centrifugation" (16 Dec 2019)

Release 0.70.1 brings no new functionality focusing on internal node
improvements instead. Some bugs were fixed, refactoring was done and
performance was improved substantially.

Behaviour changes:
 * as with the previous release, this one changes the database format, so you
   need to resynchronize your nodes
 * code testing will fail if you're not to checkout submodules (we have one
   with neo-vm tests, #543)

Improvements:

## 0.62.0 "Commotion" (07 Nov 2019)

Release 0.62.0 finishes one very important work some pieces of which were
gradually rolled out in previous releases --- it integrates all neo-vm project
JSON-based tests for NEO 2.0 C# VM and runs them successfully against neo-go
VM. There are also important bug fixes based on mainnet nodes deployment
experience and additional configuration options.

New Features:
 * implemented `Runtime.Serialize` and `Runtime.Deserialize` syscalls (#419)
 * new configuration option -- `AttemptConnPeers` to set the number of
   connections that the node will try to establish when it goes below the
   MinPeers setting (#478)
 * `LogPath` configuration parameter to write logs into some file and not to
   stdout (#460), not enabled by default

   `inspect` subcommand was removed from `neo-go vm` (it dumped avm files in
   previous release) (#463)
 * the default minimum peers was reduced to 3 for privnet setups to avoid
   useless reconnections to only 4 available nodes

 * block's transaction verification enabled for privnet setups, mainnet and
   testnet don't have it enabled

Technical improvements:
 * GetVarIntSize and GetVarStringSize were removed from the io package (use
   GetVarSize instead; #408)
 * OVER implementation was optimized to not pop the top element from the stack
   (#406, part of #196 work)
 * vm.VM was extended with HasFailed() method to check its state (previously
   external VM users couldn't do it; #411)
 * redesigned input block queue mechanism, now it's completely moved out of
   the Blockchain, which only accepts the next block via AddBlock() (#414)
 * unpersisted blocks are now fully available with the Blockchain (thus we
   have symmetry now in AddBlock/GetBlock APIs; #414, #366)
 * removed duplicating batch structures from BoltDB and Redis code, now all of
   them use the same batch as MemoryStore does (#414)
 * MemoryStore was exporting its mutex for no good reason, now it's hidden

 * VM has now completely separated instruction read and execution phases
   (#417)
 * Store interface now has Delete method (#418)
 * Store tests were reimplemented to use one test set for all Store
   implementations, including LevelDB that was not tested at all previously
   (#418)
 * Batch interface doesn't have Len method now as it's not used at all (#418)
 * New*FromRawBytes functions were renamed to New*FromASN1 in the keys
   package, previous naming made it easy to confuse them with functions
   operating with NEO serialization format (#418)
 * PublicKey's IsInfinity method is exported now (#418)
 * smartcontract package now has CreateSignatureRedeemScript() matching C#
   code (#418)
 * vm package now has helper functions

## 0.50.0 "Consolidation" (19 Sep 2019)

The first release from the new team focuses on bringing all related
development effort into one codebase, refactoring things, fixing some
long-standing bugs and adding new functionality. This release merges two
radically different development branches --- `dev` and `master` that were
present in the project (along with all associated pull requests) and also
brings in changes made to the compiler in the neo-storm project.

New features:
 * configurable storage backends supporting LevelDB, in-memory DB (for
   testing) and Redis
 * BoltDB support for storage backend
 * updated and extended interop APIs (thanks to neo-storm)

Notable behavior changes:
 * the default configuration for privnet was changed to use ports 20331 and
   20332 so that it doesn't clash with the default dockerized neo-privnet
   setups
 * the default configuration path was changed from `../config` to `./config`,
   at this stage it makes life a bit easier for development, later this will
   be changed to some sane default for production version
 * VM CLI now supports type inference for `run` parameters (you don't need to
   specify types explicitly in most of the cases) and treats `operation`
   parameter as mandatory if anything is passed to `run`
 
VM improvements:
 * added implementation for `EQUAL`, `NZ`, `PICK`, `TUCK`, `XDROP`, `INVERT`,
   `CAT`, `SUBSTR`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `UNPACK`, `REVERSE`, `REMOVE`
 * expanded tests
 * better error messages for different erroneous code
 * implemented item conversions following neo-vm behavior: array to/from
   struct, bigint to/from boolean, anything to bytearray and anything to
   boolean
 * improved compatibility with neo-vm (#394)

Technical improvements:
 * switched to Go 1.12+
 * gofmt, golint (#213)
 * fixed and improved CircleCI builds
 * removed internal rfc6969 package (#285)
 * refactored util/crypto/io packages, removed a lot of duplicating code
 * updated READMEs and user-level documents
 * update Makefile with useful targets
 * dropped internal base58 implementation (#355)
 * updated default seed lists for mainnet and testnet from neo-cli

Bugs fixed:
 * a lot of compiler fixes from neo-storm
 * data access race in memory-backed storage backend (#313)
 * wrong comparison opcode emitted by compiler (#294)
 * decoding error in `publish` transactions (#179)
 * decoding error in `invocation` transactions (#173)
 * panic in `state` transaction decoding
 * double VM run from CLI (#96)
 * non-constant time crypto (#245)
 * APPEND pushed value on the stack and worked for bytearrays (#391)
 * reading overlapping hash blocks from the DB leading to blockchain state
   neo-go couldn't recover from (#393)
 * codegen for `append()` wasn't type-aware and emitted wrong code (#395)
 * node wasn't trying to reconnect to other node if connection failed (#390)
 * stricly follow handshare procedure (#396)
 * leaked connections if disconnect happened before handshake completed (#396)

### Inherited unreleased changes

Some changes were also done before transition to the new team, highlights are:
 * improved RPC testing
 * implemented `getaccountstate`, `validateaddress`, `getrawtransaction` and
   `sendrawtransaction` RPC methods in server
 * fixed `getaccountstate` RPC implementation
 * implemented graceful blockchain shutdown with proper DB closing

## 0.45.14 (not really released, 05 Dec 2018)

This one can technically be found in the git history and attributed to commit
fa1da2cb917cf4dfccbe49d44c5741eec0e0bb65, but it has no tag in the repository
and so can't count as a properly released thing. Still it can be marked as a
point in history with the following changes relative to 0.44.10:
 * switched to Go modules for dependency management
 * various optimizations for basic structures like Uin160/Uint256/Fixed8
 * improved testing
 * added support for `invoke` method in RPC client
 * implemented `getassetstate` in RPC server
 * fixed NEP2Encrypt and added tests
 * added `NewPrivateKeyFromRawBytes` function to the `wallet` package

## 0.44.10 (27 Sep 2018)

This is the last one tagged in the repository, so it's considered as the last
one properly released before 0.50+. Releases up to 0.44.10 seem to be made in
automated fashion and you can find their [changes on
GitHub](https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neo-go/releases).
